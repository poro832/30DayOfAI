For Day 1, our goal is to establish a connection between our Streamlit app and a Snowflake database. Once that's done, we'll run a simple query to confirm the connection is working and display the Snowflake version in the app.

So to get started, sign up for a [free Snowflake trial account](https://signup.snowflake.com/?trial=student&cloud=aws&region=us-west-2&utm_source=streamlit-campaign&utm_campaign=30daysofai) using this link and you'll have access for 120 days. The trial includes plenty of credits to get you through the entire 30-day challenge, plus extra for experimenting with other features.

### :material/settings: How It Works: Step-by-Step

Let's break down what each part of the code does.

#### Connection Setup

Before running Day 1, you need to configure your Snowflake connection based on where you're deploying:

##### Streamlit in Snowflake (Recommended) :material/check_circle:

**No setup needed!** Just create a Streamlit app in Snowsight and the connection works automatically. Skip to **Step 1** below.

##### Local Development or Streamlit Community Cloud

**One-time setup required.** Create `.streamlit/secrets.toml` in your project folder:

```toml
[connections.snowflake]
account = "xy12345.us-east-1"       # Find in Snowsight → Account → View account details
user = "yourusername"               # Your Snowflake username
password = "yourpassword"           # Your Snowflake password
role = "ACCOUNTADMIN"               # Your role
warehouse = "COMPUTE_WH"            # Your warehouse
database = "SNOWFLAKE_LEARNING_DB"  # Your database
schema = "PUBLIC"                   # Your schema
```

**Important:** Add `.streamlit/secrets.toml` to your `.gitignore` file. Never commit secrets to Git!

For Streamlit Community Cloud, add these same values in your app's secrets settings.

#### 1. Import Libraries

```python
import streamlit as st
```

* **`import streamlit as st`**: Imports the Streamlit library, which is used to build the web app's user interface (UI).

#### 2. Connect to Snowflake

```python
# Auto-detect environment and connect
try:
    from snowflake.snowpark.context import get_active_session
    session = get_active_session()
except:
    from snowflake.snowpark import Session
    session = Session.builder.configs(st.secrets["connections"]["snowflake"]).create()
```

* **`from snowflake.snowpark.context import get_active_session`**: Imports the function that gets the current active Snowflake session. This works automatically in Streamlit in Snowflake (SiS).
* **`session = get_active_session()`**: Establishes an authenticated Snowflake session. This connection object is stored in the `session` variable.
* **`except` block**: If `get_active_session()` fails (meaning we're running locally or on Community Cloud), we fall back to using secrets from the `.streamlit/secrets.toml` file.
* **`Session.builder.configs(...)`**: Creates a Snowflake session using the connection parameters from `st.secrets`.

> :material/lightbulb: **Why the try/except?** This pattern makes your code work in all three environments: Streamlit in Snowflake (production), local development, and Streamlit Community Cloud. One codebase works everywhere!

#### 3. Query Snowflake Version

```python
# Query and display Snowflake version
version = session.sql("SELECT CURRENT_VERSION()").collect()[0][0]
```

* **`session.sql(...)`**: Uses our `session` object to execute a raw SQL query (`"SELECT CURRENT_VERSION()"`) on the Snowflake database.
* **`.collect()[0][0]`**: Fetches the query's result. `.collect()` brings the data (which is a list of rows) into our script. `[0]` selects the first row, and the second `[0]` selects the first column in that row, which contains the version number string.

#### 4. Display Results

```python
st.success(f"Successfully connected! Snowflake Version: {version}")
```

* **`st.success(...)`**: Shows a green success message with the Snowflake version number embedded using an f-string. This confirms both that the connection works and displays the version in a single, simple message.

When this code runs, you will see a green success message displaying your Snowflake version. This confirms your connection is working correctly.

> :material/lightbulb: **What if it fails?** If the connection fails in Streamlit in Snowflake, try refreshing the app or checking your role permissions. For local development, ensure your `.streamlit/secrets.toml` file exists in the project root with all 7 required parameters (account, user, password, role, warehouse, database, schema).
