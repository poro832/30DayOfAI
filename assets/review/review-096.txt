Ski Goggles

2023-12-03

The author had difficulty finding ski goggles with a comfortable fit due to a smaller facial structure. However, they found goggles with an appropriate frame size and multi-layer face foam that conformed to their facial contours, providing all-day comfort without pressure points or gaps. The strap also adjusted to fit over a helmet, and the optical clarity and helmet integration were excellent. These features are particularly beneficial for skiers or riders with smaller faces or sensitivity to pressure points.
