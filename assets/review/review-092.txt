The stock heat-moldable liner of Pro Ski Boots offers impressive comfort and precision after a proper fitting and heating process. It conforms well to the shape of the feet, addressing minor pressure points, and significantly improves heel hold. The material molds effectively and maintains its shape, providing good warmth and moisture management on snow. The customized fit is consistent throughout the season, making an aftermarket liner unnecessary for many skiers.
