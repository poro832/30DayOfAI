These skis are best suited for strong advanced to expert skiers due to their demanding nature and requirement for perfect technique. They offer remarkable responsiveness, stability, and edge hold for precise skiing on groomers, but are unforgiving for those who lack the necessary skills. Newer skiers are advised to master less challenging equipment first.
