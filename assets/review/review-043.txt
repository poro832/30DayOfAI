Alpine Skis

2023-10-15

The Alpine Skis were tested across various conditions, demonstrating reliable edge hold on firm ice, decent maneuverability in powder, and reasonable dampness in heavy crud. They offer a versatile and balanced performance, suitable for an advanced skier seeking a single-ski quiver for varied terrain. Their construction quality is solid, and they live up to their all-mountain billing, but don't dominate any single condition.
