Carbon Fiber Poles

2023-10-22

The trekking poles have lightweight aluminum construction, making them ideal for long hikes, but their powder baskets are too small for deep snow conditions. The locking mechanism for adjusting pole length is inconvenient in cold weather. Overall, they're decent for three-season hiking but need improvement for winter use and cold weather performance.
