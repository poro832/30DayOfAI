The reviewer tested goggles with interchangeable lenses, finding the lenses themselves to be of high quality but the lens-changing process to be somewhat fiddly and not entirely hassle-free. Once the lens is in place, it feels secure and the fit is comfortable. The reviewer concludes that frequent lens changers may find the process annoying, but those who keep the same lens or change infrequently will appreciate the clarity and security of the lens.
