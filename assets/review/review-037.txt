Carbon Fiber Poles

2023-11-13

These poles are a mid-range option for recreational skiers and hikers, offering reliable performance for everyday use and moderate backcountry tours. They have comfortable grips with easy-to-adjust straps, but are heavier and less strong than premium options. The locking mechanism works well, but may require occasional retightening. They offer a good balance of functionality and value for casual users, but serious athletes or frequent backcountry users may prefer more robust options.
