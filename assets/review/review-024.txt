Thermal Gloves

2023-11-17

The Thermal Gloves provided adequate warmth for moderately cold temperatures but had inconsistent touchscreen compatibility, especially when wet or for complex gestures. They offered decent wind and water resistance and had a comfortable fit, but their bulkiness limited dexterity for precise screen interactions. For occasional, basic phone use, they offer functional touchscreen capability alongside standard thermal protection. However, for those requiring seamless touchscreen interaction, they might be disappointing.
