The ski goggles performed well during Jackson Hole's harsh winter conditions, withstanding cold temperatures, maintaining a good seal, and delivering clear vision through effective anti-fog technology. The goggles offered excellent contrast in low light and protection against glare and UV in bright light. Lens swapping was adequate for handling rapid weather changes, and the goggles were comfortable with good helmet integration and moisture management. The lens surface proved scratch-resistant. These goggles are a top choice for serious skiers due to their exceptional anti-fog properties and high-quality optics in various lighting conditions.
