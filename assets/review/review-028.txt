Insulated Jacket

2023-12-25

The insulated jacket is great for casual use and everyday activities during colder months due to its modern style, good warmth-to-weight ratio, ease of maintenance, and convenient storage. However, it lacks breathability and its DWR finish wears off quickly when used as an active midlayer for skiing or other strenuous activities.
