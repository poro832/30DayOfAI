Pro Ski Boots

2023-10-25

After testing, the Pro Ski Boots proved to be a high-performance interface for serious skiers. Custom fit is essential, requiring heat molding for optimal comfort. Power transmission is excellent, with impressive heel hold and solid support for aggressive skiing. Downhill performance is catered to serious skiers, with a stiff flex for carving and navigating challenging conditions. Compatibility features enhance versatility across different binding systems. The walk mode offers functional range of motion for moderate backcountry tours but is noticeably heavier and less plush than dedicated touring boots. The boots offer a strong compromise for skiers splitting time between resort and backcountry.
