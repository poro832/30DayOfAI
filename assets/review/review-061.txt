Thermal Gloves

2023-12-24

The Thermal Gloves have withstood three seasons of demanding use as ski patroller gear, despite waterproofing diminishing and insulation packing out. Leather palms and stitching have remained durable, with only wrist leashes failing. Overall, they offer decent warmth and provide good value for professionals in harsh, wet, cold environments.
