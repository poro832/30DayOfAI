2023-11-19

The Thermal Gloves performed well in Minnesota's harsh winter biking conditions, providing essential warmth and wind protection down to -25°F windchills. However, dexterity was a challenge, making precise control and manipulation of smaller items difficult. The exterior fabric showed good resistance to abrasion, and breathability was sufficient for moderate biking efforts. Overall, these gloves are ideal for dedicated winter cyclists prioritizing maximum warmth and wind protection.
