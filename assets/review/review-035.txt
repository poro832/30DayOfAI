Insulated Jacket

2023-12-25

This insulated jacket was used for winter hiking and snowshoeing in New Hampshire's White Mountains, known for damp cold, high winds, and steep climbs. Its standout features include effective moisture management, reasonable breathability, wind blocking, athletic cut, and well-placed pockets. However, it has moderate warmth and isn't suitable for deep cold or less active pursuits, and its DwR face fabric sheds light moisture but isn't waterproof.
