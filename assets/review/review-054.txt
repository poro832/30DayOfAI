2023-11-15

These Alpine Skis are beneficial for beginner to early intermediate skiers, helping build confidence and rhythm during the transition from snowplow turns to linked parallel turns. They are easy to initiate turns with, providing forgiveness for balance mistakes and stability on groomed slopes. While not suitable for advanced techniques or high speeds, they are an excellent choice for learning fundamental skills and gaining confidence.
