Mountain Series Helmet

2023-12-14

The Mountain Series Helmet provided decent protection but was uncomfortable for extended use due to problematic ear pads and chin strap. The ear pads created pressure points and felt abrasive, interfered with helmet audio systems, and muffled sounds. The chin strap and buckle system were fiddly to adjust and caused chafing and discomfort during skiing. Despite adequate ventilation and protection, the persistent discomfort made it a poor choice due to ergonomic failures.
