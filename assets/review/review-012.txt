The goggles developed multiple scratches on the lenses despite careful use and proper storage within six days of skiing. The anti-fog coating was effective, but the durability was disappointing, as the scratches affected the field of vision. Expected better durability given the premium price point and advertised scratch-resistant coating. Previous goggles from a competitor brand lasted longer.
