Mountain Series Helmet

2023-10-27

The helmet offers reliable protection and all-day comfort with effective padding and ergonomic shape. However, its integrated audio system disappoints due to short battery life in cold conditions and frequent Bluetooth dropouts. The ventilation system and micro-adjustable fit system are notable features. Overall, the helmet is a good choice for protection and comfort, but its audio features need improvement for the premium price.
