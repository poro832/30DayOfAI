Pro Ski Boots

2023-12-14

The Pro Ski Boots offer excellent control and responsiveness but are not warm enough for consistently frigid conditions, restricting blood circulation and causing painfully cold feet. Attempts to keep warm with thick or heated socks further compromised the fit, making them unsuitable for frequent use in arctic temperatures or those with cold toes. The design prioritizes performance over thermal capabilities.
