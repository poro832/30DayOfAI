Insulated Jacket

2023-12-09

The Insulated Jacket was used primarily as a belay parka during ice and rock climbing, providing instant warmth and reducing heat loss during long, static belays. Its synthetic insulation handled damp conditions well and was packable. The fit was roomy for easy layering, and durability was adequate. While not the lightest or warmest option, its practicality and moisture tolerance made it a reliable choice for staying warm during cold belays.
