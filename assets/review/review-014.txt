Alpine Base Layer

2023-12-17

The Alpine Base Layer was initially comfortable and effective at managing moisture and providing warmth. However, its long-term durability was disappointing, with noticeable pilling, loss of shape and elasticity, and minor seam failures after a season and a half of use. Despite its initial positive attributes, the poor long-term durability made its overall value questionable compared to more robust alternatives.
