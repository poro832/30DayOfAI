Thermal Gloves

2023-10-21

These thermal gloves offer reliable warmth for moderate winter activities, with good synthetic insulation and weather resistance. However, they don't excel in extremely cold or wet conditions, and breathability is only moderate. Dexterity is compromised due to bulk, and durability is respectable. Overall, they are a solid, if slightly conventional, option for general winter use.
