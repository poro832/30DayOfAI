The author extensively tested ski goggles in various light conditions and weather patterns in the Rocky Mountains, evaluating their optical clarity, anti-fog coatings, helmet integration, and comfort during 25+ days on snow. The testing included contrasting environments, such as bright and dry conditions in Colorado and challenging flat-light and heavy snowfall in the Pacific Northwest, to provide a comprehensive assessment of their performance.
