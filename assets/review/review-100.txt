The author had a great experience using prescription ski goggles during a skiing season at Steamboat and Winter Park. The goggles' design provided comfort for medium-sized prescription frames, eliminated fogging issues, and offered clear lens optics and a draft-free seal. The goggles' excellent OTG integration made skiing with glasses feel natural, addressing the challenges of pressure, fogging, and comfort for prescription eyewear users.
